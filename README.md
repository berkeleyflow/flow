# Flow

[Flow](https://berkeleyflow.github.io) is a computational framework for deep RL and control experiments for traffic microsimulation.

See [our website](https://berkeleyflow.github.io) for more information on the application of Flow to several mixed-autonomy traffic scenarios. Other [results and videos](https://sites.google.com/view/ieee-tro-flow/home) are available as well.

<!-- ## Getting Started

- TODO: Tutorial for visualization / plot generating scripts

Sumo Params:

- Port required, recommended set to 8873
- Timestep, recommended is 0.01, default is 1.0
- TODO: Same flags as SUMO Popen, make it more robust

Env Params:

- These will change based on the scenario
- Target Velocity

Net Params:

- For each environment, you should determine which net params are relevant.
- Used in Generator files that are specific to each scenario?
- "length" : length of the track
- "lanes" : number of lanes
- "speed_limit"
- "resolution" : number of nodes per edge, affects how 'circular' the track appears when visualized but doesn't affect performance [sic] (e.g. if you have 4 edges for a circle and resolution=2 it will display as 12 lines in the gui)
- "net_path" : path for the folder where the net XML files will be saved: edg.xml, .netccfg, nod.xml, typ.xml
- Suggestion: Direct control of naming of XML files

Configuration (Cfg) Params:

- "start_time" : 0
- "end_time" : When the simulation ends, so pick a reasonably large number
- TODO(cathywu) what are the units of start/end time?
- "cfg_path" : path for the folder where the cfg XML files will be saved: add.xml, gui.cfg, net.xml, rou.xml, sumo.cfg

Vehicle Params:

- Dictionary of car type tag -> (count, car following controller, lane changing controller) assignments, where controller is a method.
- Specifies number of cars for each type
- "Type" : (Number of cars, Car Following Model, Lane Changing Model)
- "rl": No car following model, action determined by RL algorithm
- All other types can have arbitrary names because their actions/updates are determined by the models (other functions in the tuple)
- Suggestion: instead of having "rl" be specific, we could have it such that None or a RL HOF are recognized as "rl vehicles"; Other suggestion: specifying controlled_vehicle_params and rl_params
- TODO(cathywu) include an example here

### Vehicle Params

Implemented car following models:

- Basic Car Following Model
	- per [Horn 2013](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6728204/)
	- Only considers vehicle ahead.
	- Terms for desired velocity and headway gap
- Bilateral Control Model
	- per [Horn 2013](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6728204/)
	- Considers vehicle ahead and vehicle behind.
	- Term for desired velocity. Another term to place self halfway between car ahead and car behind.
- Optimal Vehicle Model
	- per [Jin & Gabor 2014](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~orosz/articles/CDC_2014_Jin.pdf)
	- Only considers vehicle ahead.
	- Desired velocity term is a function of headway. Also seeks to match velocity of car ahead.


Lane changing models:

- No lane changing
- Stochastic lane changer

Warnings:
====
All car controllers come equipped with a fail-safe rule wherein cars are not allowed to
move at a speed that would cause them to crash if the car in front of them suddenly started
breaking with max acceleration. If they attempt to do so, they will be reset to move at $$v_safe$$
where $$v_safe$$ is the speed such that the cars will come to rest at the same point.  -->
